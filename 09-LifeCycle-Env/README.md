# Define your infrastructure's Lifecycle Environment

### The application life cycle is a concept central to Foreman's content management functions. The application life cycle defines how a particular system and its software look at a specific stage. For example, an application life cycle might be simple; you might only have a development stage and production stage. Foreman provides methods to customize each application life cycle stage in a controlled manner to suit your specifications.


#### 1. In the Foreman web UI, navigate to Content >Lifecycle Environments.
#### 2. Click New Environment Path to start a new application life cycle.
#### 3. In the Name field, enter a name for your environment.
#### 4. In the Description field, enter a description for your environment.
#### 5. Click Save.
    

### Add as many environment paths as you need. For example, you can create dev, test, stage, and production environments. To add these environments, click Add New Environment, complete the Name and Description fields, and select the prior environment from the Prior Environment list so that you chain them together in the sequence you expect to use.

### Prefer to have [Dev, Testing, Prod]
