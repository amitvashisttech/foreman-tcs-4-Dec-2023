# Create an Activation Key

### To register a CentOS Stream server to the content you have defined in a particular lifecycle, you must create an activation key. The activation key is a secure method of sharing credentials with a server. This uses a tool called subscription-manager to subscribe the CentOS Stream server to the content.

When you have created the activation key, add the CentOS Stream subscription to the activation key.

```
1. In the Foreman web UI, navigate to Content > Activation keys and click Create Activation Key.
2. In the Name field, enter the name of the activation key.
3. In the Description field, enter a description for the activation key.
4. From the Environment list, select the environment to use.
5. From the Content View list, select the Content View you created just now.
6. Click Save.
```
